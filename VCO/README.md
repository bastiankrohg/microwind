# VCO - Voltage controlled oscillator
INSA Toulouse 4th Year AE - SE - EMCA project
This folder contains a voltage controlled oscillator modelled in Microwind 3nm as a part of a 4th year active electronics course (EMCA). 
The model is inspired by and based on Sonia Ben Dhia's thesis work at INSA de Toulouse.
You can also find Nicolas SIARD and myself's report on this subject in a pdf in this same folder.
